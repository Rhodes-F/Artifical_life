Inorder to run this code first please clone the repository and enter the assignment_5 branch. Then run main.py which will install the requirements and then run the search algorithm. The current search is set to run for 1 generation with a population size of 1 and have a maximum number of links of 6 awith a max size being 1 and a min being .01 but this can be reconfigured in constants.py
